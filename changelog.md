***CHANGELOG***

- Removed a few things, including the empty, clear, inorder and postorder
- Found that the delete function seems to work fine 
- Found that the search function is able to validate 
- Found that the main function needs to have that L/R/RT indicator for the tree


**ISSUES**
- sometimes the entry decides to go in the 0-399 errors for stack overflow
- not able to figure out L/R/RT
- commenting needs some help
